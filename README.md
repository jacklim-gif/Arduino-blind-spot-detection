ðŸš— Arduino Blind Spot Detection System

This project is an Arduino-based blind spot detection system designed to improve vehicle safety. Using ultrasonic sensors, the system detects objects in the driverâ€™s blind spot and provides a warning signal through LEDs or a buzzer.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

Detects vehicles/objects in blind spots
Alerts driver with visual and/or audio signals
Low-cost and easy-to-build prototype
Based on Arduino Uno with ultrasonic sensors

ðŸ”¹ Hardware Used
Arduino Uno
Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04)
LEDs & Buzzer
Jumper wires & breadboard

This project demonstrates how embedded systems can be applied to real-world safety solutions in automotive technology.
