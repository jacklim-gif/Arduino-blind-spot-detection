# ðŸš— Arduino Blind Spot Detection System

This project is an Arduino-based blind spot detection system designed to improve vehicle safety. Using ultrasonic sensors, the system detects objects in the driverâ€™s blind spot and provides a warning signal through LEDs or a buzzer.

## Key Features
1. Detects vehicles/objects in blind spots  
2. Alerts driver with visual and/or audio signals  
3. Low-cost and easy-to-build prototype  
4. Based on Arduino Uno with ultrasonic sensors  

## Hardware Used
1. Arduino Uno  
2. Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04)  
3. LEDs & Buzzer  
4. Jumper wires & breadboard  

This project demonstrates how embedded systems can be applied to real-world safety solutions in automotive technology.
